# Progress

Checkpoints for every feature, phase by phase (from the architecture plan). Tick a box only
when it is true _and verified_; link the evidence (test file, PR) where useful. Decisions
and gotchas go in [memory.md](memory.md).

## Definition of Done (applies to every feature)

Copy this list under a new feature and tick it off:

- [ ] **Implemented** behind the API's authorization rules (no client-trusted roles/IDs)
- [ ] **Unit tests** next to the code (`*.test.ts[x]`) for logic, guards, components
- [ ] **Smoke test** `tests/smoke/specs/<feature>.smoke.ts` covering the critical path
- [ ] **Security** review (`security-reviewer` agent): authz, input validation, CSRF, secrets, logging of PII
- [ ] **Performance** review (`performance-reviewer` agent): queries/indexes, payload & JS budget
- [ ] **Accessibility** (`accessibility-reviewer` agent): WCAG 2.2 AA, axe clean in smoke suite, keyboard path
- [ ] **i18n** (`i18n-reviewer` agent): no literal UI text, `el` + `en` catalogs complete, Intl formatting
- [ ] **Contracts & docs**: OpenAPI/client regenerated, migrations reviewed, memory.md updated if something non-obvious was learned

Legend: `[x]` done · `[ ]` not done · `[~]` partially done (say what is missing)

## Phase 1: Foundation and authentication

### 1.1 Monorepo and tooling

- [x] pnpm workspaces + Turborepo (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tests/*`)
- [x] Shared TS / ESLint / Prettier config (`packages/config`)
- [x] Docker Compose: Postgres 17 + PostGIS 3.6, Redis 8.8
- [x] CI: format, lint, typecheck, build, migrations, drift checks, unit + smoke tests
- [x] Dependency audit job + Dependabot
- [ ] Staging/production environments, secret store, deploy pipeline

### 1.2 Database and migrations

- [x] Drizzle schema + versioned SQL migrations, runtime migrator (`pnpm db:migrate`)
- [x] PostGIS and btree_gist enabled first
- [x] Unit tests: conventions for every table (`schema/conventions.test.ts`), journal integrity (`migrations.test.ts`)
- [x] Smoke: API readiness proves DB connectivity (`platform-health.smoke.ts`)
- [x] CI: migrations apply twice (idempotent) and schema has no unmigrated changes

### 1.3 Authentication (Better Auth)

- [x] Email + password sign-up / sign-in / sign-out; UUID ids; role not client-settable
- [x] Two-factor verification at sign-in (TOTP)
- [ ] 2FA enrolment UI (needed before any admin can use admin routes) → Phase 5
- [ ] Email verification + password reset (needs Resend)
- [x] Unit tests: auth config (`packages/auth/src/index.test.ts`), forms (`sign-in-form`, `sign-up-form`, `two-factor-form` tests)
- [x] Smoke: `auth.smoke.ts`
- [x] Security: shared password policy, locale validation hook, open-redirect guard, CSRF origin check (Better Auth + API)
- [ ] Rate limits backed by Redis (currently per-instance memory) + `trustedProxies` configured
- [x] Accessibility: axe-clean forms, errors linked via `aria-describedby`, translated alerts
- [x] i18n: all copy + Better Auth error codes translated (el/en)

### 1.4 API session verification and contracts

- [x] Global `AuthGuard` (`@Public`, `@Roles('admin')` + MFA), `OriginGuard` (CSRF)
- [x] `/v1/me` parsed through `MeResponseSchema`; OpenAPI emitted; client generated; CI drift check
- [x] Unit tests: guards, controllers, OpenAPI bridge; integration: `apps/api/test/auth.integration.test.ts`
- [x] Smoke: `api-session.smoke.ts`

### 1.5 Platform: health, logging, worker

- [x] API `/health` + `/health/ready`; worker `/health` + `/health/ready`
- [x] Structured logs with request IDs (pino); cookies/headers not logged
- [x] Worker skeleton with scheduled `maintenance` queue (heartbeat)
- [x] Unit tests: health controller, worker processor + env
- [x] Smoke: `platform-health.smoke.ts`
- [ ] Sentry + alerting (booking/webhook failures, queue backlog)
- [ ] Graceful worker shutdown verified on Linux (not testable on the Windows dev box)

### 1.6 Internationalization

- [x] next-intl with `/el` and `/en` prefixes, Accept-Language negotiation, `hreflang` alternates
- [x] Catalog parity + ICU argument + coverage tests (`messages/catalogs.test.ts`)
- [x] Language switcher (links, endonyms, `aria-current`), preference saved on the account
- [x] Lint rule forbids literal UI text
- [x] Smoke: `i18n.smoke.ts`
- [ ] Native-speaker review of Greek copy
- [ ] Localized emails (when email lands)

### 1.7 Security baseline

- [x] Nonce-based CSP (`proxy.ts`), HSTS, frame/nosniff/referrer/permissions headers
- [x] Helmet on the API; body size limits; global rate limit (in-memory)
- [x] Unit tests: CSP builder, safe redirects; smoke: `security.smoke.ts` (headers, nonce on every script, no CSP violations, cookie flags, CSRF)
- [ ] Security review of deployment (TLS, secret rotation, backups) → Phase 6

### 1.8 Accessibility baseline

- [x] Skip link, single `main` landmark, `lang` per page, focus-visible styles
- [x] axe in unit tests (jsdom) and smoke tests (real browser, both locales, WCAG 2.2 AA)
- [x] Smoke: `accessibility.smoke.ts`
- [ ] Manual screen-reader pass (NVDA + VoiceOver) before launch

### 1.9 Performance baseline

- [x] First-visit JS and request budgets; API readiness latency budget (`performance.smoke.ts`)
- [ ] Trim client JS: header pulls the Better Auth client on every page; all message namespaces are sent to the client
- [ ] Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals monitoring in production

## Phase 2: Owner onboarding and inventory (blocked on decisions in memory.md)

- [ ] Owner profiles + verification states
- [ ] Facilities (`parking_locations`, PostGIS point, IANA time zone) and spaces
- [ ] Named units and pooled inventory
- [ ] Photos (S3), listing status, amenities
- [ ] Schedules and availability exceptions (DST-safe in Europe/Athens)
- [ ] Pricing rules + server-side quotes (integer minor units)
- [ ] Exit criteria: an owner manages their facility without reaching another owner's data (smoke + integration test)

## Phase 3: Search and booking engine

- [ ] Geospatial search + listing pages (Mapbox, CSP updated deliberately)
- [ ] Availability + quote endpoints
- [ ] Transactional allocation + holds (exclusion constraints, `[start, end)`)
- [ ] Hold expiry worker, cancellations, booking history
- [ ] Concurrency tests (named spot race, last pooled unit) and DST edge cases
- [ ] Transactional outbox

## Phase 4: Payments and payouts

- [ ] Confirm Stripe Connect eligibility + funds flow
- [ ] Connected-account onboarding
- [ ] Checkout, signed webhooks, idempotency, payment state machine
- [ ] Refunds, fees, transfers, ledger, reconciliation
- [ ] Late-payment and dispute workflows

## Phase 5: Owner and admin dashboards

- [ ] 2FA enrolment UI; admin MFA enforced end to end
- [ ] Owner calendar, bookings, listings, earnings
- [ ] Admin approvals, moderation, users, bookings, payments, audit logs

## Phase 6: Production readiness

- [ ] Security + privacy review, GDPR retention and data-subject workflows
- [ ] Backups, restore drill, monitoring, alerts, runbooks
- [ ] Load tests for search and booking
- [ ] Payment failure/refund/dispute/reconciliation tests
- [ ] Staged pilot
